/**
 * gitg UIElement interface.
 *
 * The GitgExtView interface can be implemented to provide a main view in
 * gitg. An example of such views are the builtin Dashboard, History and
 * Commit views.
 *
 * Implementations of the GitgExtView interface will be integrated
 * automatically in the gitg interface according to the various interface
 * methods and properties that need to be implemented.
 *
 * To provide a default navigation when the view is active, the
 * #GitgExtView::navigation property should be implemented and should return a
 * non-null #GitgExtNavigation. This navigation section will always be present
 * at the top of the navigation menu. Note that you should normally ''not''
 * export this type to Peas because you will end up having the navigation
 * shown twice in the UI.
